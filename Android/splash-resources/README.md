Splash resources placeholder folder.

Contains placeholder PNGs at several densities to be copied into the Android project's `res/mipmap-*` or `res/drawable-*` folders when you're ready to update the native splash.

If you want, tell me which splash (splash1/splash2/splash3) you'd like and I can run the script to copy them into the native project for you.
